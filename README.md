## What is Aricoin?
Aricoin is a a digital currency descended from Bitcoin. Unlike Bitcoin it does not use SHA256 as its proof of work (POW). Aricoin employs a simplified variant of scrypt much like Litecoin. The goal of the Aricoin Project is to make cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. Aricoin enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere. The Aricoin Network uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. The Aricoin Network is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency. The Aricoin Project is a collective of developers who share the same vision - making cryptocurrency accessible to everyone. 

For more information, as well as an immediately useable, binary version of
the Aricoin Network software, see [http://aricoin.org](http://aricoin.org).

## Development and contributions
Developers work in their own trees, then submit pull requests when
they think their feature or bug fix is ready.

The patch will be accepted if there is broad consensus that it is a
good thing.  Developers should expect to rework and resubmit patches
if they don't match the project's coding conventions (see coding.txt)
or are controversial.

The master branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed
to be completely stable. Tags are regularly created to indicate new
official, stable release versions of Aricoin.

Feature branches are created when there are major new features being
worked on by several people.

From time to time a pull request will become outdated. If this occurs, and
the pull is no longer automatically mergeable; a comment on the pull will
be used to issue a warning of closure. The pull will be closed 15 days
after the warning if action is not taken by the author. Pull requests closed
in this manner will have their corresponding issue labeled 'stagnant'.

Issues with no commits will be given a similar warning, and closed after
15 days from their last activity. Issues closed in this manner will be 
labeled 'stale'.
